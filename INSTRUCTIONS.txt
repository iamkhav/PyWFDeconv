~~ Installation
Put the xx folder into your Python Project.
Use "import xx" for default usage. This contains function wrappers that execute most of the code.
If you want to get into the individual functions, you'll have to import sub-packages (as in "import xx.convar" e.g.).

~~ Notes
If you want to use experimental features, you have to downgrade to Python 3.7.
Numba doesn't support newer Python Version atm (Mar 2021).
